openclinica-rules-compiler
==========================

The OpenClinica Rules compiler makes writing validation rules for OpenClinica easier.
It reads a simplified declaration of a set of rules and generates the OpenClinica RuleImport XML.

The compiler as well as its documentation is contained in the HTML file [oc-rules-compiler.html].
Open that file in your browser and press the Example button to see an annotated sample.

Please report any bugs to its author, Marco van Zwetselaar <zwets@kcri.ac.tz>
