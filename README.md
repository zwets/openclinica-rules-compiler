==========================

The OpenClinica Rules compiler makes writing validation rules for OpenClinica easier.

The compiler as well as its documentation is contained in the [HTML file](oc-rules-compiler.html).
Open that file and press the Example button to see the documentation and annotated sample input.

Please report any bugs to its author, Marco van Zwetselaar <zwets@kcri.ac.tz>.
